You can't wrap ...
When you bow, ...
When a rat wants to die, ...
A single hair ...
Govern a family ...
A good man in an evil society ...
Below the navel ...
A fallen lighthouse ...
What you cannot avoid ...
Visiting friends is easier ...
Fortune seldom repeats, ...
Dead songbirds ...
Pain is only ...
Not every day can be ...
One grows most tired ...
Careful feet ...
Too much enthusiasm ...
If you want a thing long enough, ...
A tree grown in the wind ...
It's better to be a live beggar ...
Pain is easier to ...
Ragged hats ...
Those arriving in darkness ...
Those who hide their faults ...
The older the ginger, ...
If you chase two rabbits, ...
He who hurries ...
Crisis is opportunity ...
Far waters ...
Defeat isn't bitter ...
Doctors are careless ...
One murder makes ...
Clumsy birds ...
Don't hit a dog ...
Don't insult the crocodile ...
Toast bread ...
Talk does not ...
There are no secrets ...
Use power ...
Arrogance always ...
Better to be quarreling ...
Dream different dreams ...
Treat thoughts as ...
If a child is uneducated, ...
Three glasses of wine ...
Desperate men ...
Courtesy never ...
He that will steal an egg ...
Don't walk in the sun ...
Those with one leg ...
If you pay peanuts, ...
When you hear hoofbeats, ...
More than polite ...
The rich fight ...
A hasty man ...
Enough is ...
Appear like a god ...
Where a chest lies open, ...
An ant may ...
Never dine ...
If you have something to say, ...
If you want an audience, ...
The first time's a favour, ...
Falling into the ditch ...
Be polite with ...
Beautiful flowers ...
A just cause ...
A bad spouse ...
Quiet rivers ...
Those who cannot boast ...
Don't open a shop ...
He who dies with the most ...
All the world's crows ...
For every wiseman, ...
Be just ...
Faded ink is truer ...
Politeness wins ...
After victory, ...
The door to charity ...
None know a son ...
Gold is tested ...
Poverty and ugliness ...
A bucket shop ...
A heart in love with beauty ...
Water bears ...
Nuts come to ...
In shallow holes, ...
Keep your broken arm ...
Even a rabbit ...
Mockery is ...
He who builds by the road ...
You can't hide an elephant ...
Pouring water on ...
When a tree falls, ...
A blind cat ...
Wealthy are those ...
Dig the well ...
A corageous foe is ...
If you look good, ...
Losing comes of ...
Indulgences have ...
Kill one soldier ...
A clear conscience ...
Those sleeping with dogs ...
An old horse ...
Patience is a ...
No famous food ...
An unseeded plant ...
Flies don't ...
Don't cover your ears ...
There's no shame in ...
To know the road ahead, ...
All towers stand ...
One happiness ...
Watching men work ...
Talented hawks ...
Catch fish ...
Two barrels of tears ...
When you throw dirt, ...
Urge people to work, ...
You have to walk ...
Don't insult the cook ...
Don't kindle a ...
Act as if no one ...
If you want respect, ...
A rumour goes ...
Knowing is easier ...
Hawks will not ...
Diseases come on horseback, ...
The weak can ...
Those who are thirsty ...
Don't ride an elephant ...
Better a flawed diamond ...
Doing may be a mistake, ...
If a string has one end, ...
Fear not going slowly, ...
Knowledge is treasure ...
Falling hurts least ...
If your words are worthless, ...
Measure your throat ...
Rotten wood ...
A bird can only roost ...
Don't cut off your nose ...
Don't let the falcon loose ...
Some prefer carrots ...
A tiger-rider ...
Solving one problem ...
The best soldiers ...
Two leaps per chasm ...
When you trip, ...
Diamonds must be cut ...
Don't keep each foot ...
Study a drunkard ...
Trees are planted ...
An obscure style ...
Conversation is a ...
Shame is forgotten ...
The mind is the ...
Everyone pushes ...
The bottom of a lighthouse ...
